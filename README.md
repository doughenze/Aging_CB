This repo is designed to guide you through the analysis process for "Spatial and molecular insights into microglial roles in cerebellar aging" - Tsai and Henze et al.

Replicating the dotplots in figure 1 can be done in the single cell directory. Additional analysis on single cell data was performed via a shiny app which was linked in the manuscript.

Replicating all heatmaps in figure 2, and any additional bulk seq figures, can be done using the code base in the bulk seq directory.

All MERFISH analysis is contained within the MERFISH directory. This is following the downloading of the main object from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Aging_MERFISH_Brains/27919227).

The order of running the notebooks is contained in the leading numbers within each of the directories.

All python scripts can be run by utilizing the Vizgen_run.sif singularity container found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14611122).
